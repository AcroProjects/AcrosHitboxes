# Acro's Hitboxes v1.2

Acro’s Hitboxes aim to streamline the process of generating knockback and damage from collision.  This addon provides custom nodes that allow the user to apply knockback and damage to an object by changing the trajectory and strength of the knockback, allowing the user to visually see the launch angle and strength to reduce the amount of trial and error from traditional knockback methods, modify the length, width, and color of the hitbox, as well as enabling and disabling the hitbox.

# Installation

Copy `addons/acro_hitboxes` into your project (final path should be `res://addons/acro_hitboxes`). Open the Godot Editor, go to **Project Settings > Plugins** and enable the **Acro's Hitbox** plugin and click **Update**. You can now add a **Hitbox** node to a scene.

# Variables

## shape (Shape2D)
This variable can affects collision shape of the hitbox

## launch_angle (int)
This variable will determine where an object will be launched if it is in contact with the hitbox

## strength (int)
This variable will determine how far an object will be launch, which is properly shown in the editor with how long the launch angle line is

## damage (int)
This variable can be used to return the amount of damage an object will take if it gets hit by a certain attack

## hit_stun (float,EXP, 0.001, 4096, .02)
This variable returns a float that can be used for the hit stun of the hitbox.  This variable is very similar to the "Timer" object

## knockback_scale (float, 0,1)
This variable returns a float from 0 to 1 and is only used for advance calculations, such as if the user wants the amount of knockback an object to receive based on the amount of damage it has already taken

## disabled (bool)
This variable works like the collisionshape2d button does (enables and disables the collision)

## reversed (bool)
This variable inverts the launch angle on its X-Axis when it's set to true

## lineThickness (int)
This variable changes the width of the launch angle line to make it easier for the user to see (for debugging purposes)

## draw_line_in_game (bool)
This variable can enable the launch angle line to be drawn when the game is running (for debugging purposes)

## hitbox_color (Color, RGBA)
This variable can change the color of the hitbox.  Keep in mind, if the color of the hitbox is oddly colored, you’ll have to go into your project settings and change the Collision Shape Color to white

# Methods

## get_launch_vector ()
Calculates the launch vector to apply knockback automatically (without parameters)

Returns:
 - Vector to apply knockback

## get_launch_vector (int launch_angle, int strength)
Calculates the launch vector to apply knockback manually (with parameters)
Parameters:
 - **launch_angle**: launch_angle
 - **strength**: length and width of the vector

Returns:
 - Vector to apply knockback
